# console-snake-cpp
This program is an implementation of the snake game for console. 

## Enhancements
Here is a small list of enhancement suggestions :
 - Use of a graphic library (SFML, Qt...).
 - Include a maximum number of movement for the snake (perhaps with movement count earned by eating food).
 - Automatic snake movement (like in a real snake game, need to handle time and non-blocking user inputs).
 - Add of obstacles.
 - Add of best score handling (if the size of the snake is not constrained).
